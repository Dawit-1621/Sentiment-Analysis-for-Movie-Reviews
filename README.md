The dataset that can be downloaded from this Kaggle link (https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).<br>
If you download the dataset and extract the compressed file, you will see a CSV file. The file contains 50,000 records and two columns: review and sentiment. The review column contains text for the review and the sentiment column contains sentiment for the review. The sentiment column can have two values i.e. `"positive" `and `"negative"` which makes our problem a binary classification problem.
